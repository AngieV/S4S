# S4S
A mobile accessible website for Songs4Soldiers.org, a non-profit organization serving combat veterans

Capstone project for LaunchCode LiftOff

Funds are raised by hosting events, by donation, by corporate sponsorship and by sales of merchandise. The organization relies heavily on volunteers for events.
The website promotes the Mission of Songs for Soldiers, raises awareness for their cause and the events which support it, collects donations which directly support the S4S Mission, offers merchandise, tickets to the Annual Fundraising Concert, an application for assistance and a listing and signup for volunteers. 
The website will be used by two subsets of users: those who want to help and those who need assistance. 

Technologies: Javascript, Java, Spring Boot
